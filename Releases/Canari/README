I've attached two tar balls. One is of a development snapshot of Canari that includes foreign lang support, and the second is your rapleaf repo in Canari package format. To get it going is pretty straightforward:

perl -MCPAN -eshell
install Config::IniFiles
exit

tar -zxvf canari-0.4.tar.gz
cd canari-0.4
python setup.py install

cd ..
tar -zxvf rapleaf-poc-canari.tar.gz
cd rapleaf/
python setup.py install
canari install-package rapleaf

Et voila! Your transforms should now appear in Maltego and run with Canari dispatcher. I did do some minor changes to your code. First, I changed the config parser to Config::IniFiles to be compatible with Canari format. Second I changed the config file to match INI config option format (i.e. option=value). A few places you'd like to look at:

Under rapleaf/src/rapleaf/:

resources/external -> this is where all your perl scripts are
resources/maltego -> this is where your entities file is and where you can place machine scripts
transforms/__init__.py -> this is the transform registry
transforms/md5torapleaf.py -> this is a sample transform with perl support. Note the 'cmd' keyword in the @configure annotation of the dotransform function
